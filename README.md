# Customer-Churn-Prediction
An e-commerce company (or a DTH provider) is facing intense competition in the current market, making it increasingly challenging to retain existing customers. To address this, the company intends to develop a churn prediction model that can identify accounts at high risk of leaving and enable the creation of segmented offers targeted at these potential churners.

In this business, account churn is a critical issue because a single account may represent multiple customers. Therefore, the loss of one account could result in the loss of multiple customers.

The responsibility of developing this churn prediction model has been assigned to the data science team, along with the task of providing actionable business recommendations for the associated campaign. The campaign suggestions must be unique and clearly define the offers, as they will be reviewed by the revenue assurance team.

If the proposed recommendations involve excessive free or heavily subsidized benefits that could result in financial losses, the revenue assurance team will not approve them. Therefore, campaign recommendations must be carefully crafted to balance customer retention with profitability.
